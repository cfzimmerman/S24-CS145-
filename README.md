# CS 145: Networks at scale

This repo has my work from CS 145, an intro to conventional and data center networking. Coursework and lectures covered layers two, three, and four with topics including ethernet, IP, routing algorithms, BGP, TCP, load balancing, switch programming, and SDN. Most projects involved designing and implementing data center network topologies in Mininet.
